### ***C99*** + ***SDL2*** + ***GLEW***

---
use CMake to create a project file using this structure.

---

all rights reserved to:
- SDL2 -> https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL
- GLEW -> https://github.com/nigels-com/glew

this lightweight framework uses the pre-compiled versions of SDL2 and GLEW to easily set up a blank project that uses these libraries, instead of having to mess with linking and putting things in the right place.
everything is put within the `inc/` folder.
